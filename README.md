Lobbit - Little Hunter of Big Things
====================================
Wowee! Can you believe I started porting this to another language already? This
version of lobbit is written in C, and I'm taking the project in another
direction (possibly temporarily). It has a unique turn based system similar to
a traditional roguelike's turns right now. It also uses the display of a
traditional roguelike. Both of these features are subject to change, and as
such, I've made the code flexible enough to do so.
